This is one of the files that the application author is required to provide.
This is where definition of (application or device)-specific parameters ought to go.

This is an example file for building firmware on linux. Anticipated target is a Raspi.
  but that shouldn't matter too much. These settings are only typically relevant for
  reasons of memory-constraint, threading model (if any), or specific features that
  this hardware can support.

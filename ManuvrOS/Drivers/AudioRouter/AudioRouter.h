/*
* We must arbitrarilly assign inputs to rows or columns in the crosspoint switch. Since we don't want to allow
*   signal collision/mixing at the outputs, and since the crosspoint switch would allow us to do that on accident,
*   we must enforce those constraints in this class. To that end, we will consider the crosspoint's rows (12 pins)
*   to be the inputs.
*
* Given that, the class needs to ensure that two rows cannot both be attached to the same column. It should be
*   reiterated that this constraint is a software choice, and there is nothing preventing a user of this class
*   from re-tooling it to work in a different way entirely. If this is attempted, some other set of constraints
*   must be enforced to ensure that a program using this class cannot short-circuit the switch, otherwise magic smoke
*   might get released.
*
* Another consideration: There are 8 digital potentiometers on the PCB attached to the columns. The class is presently
*   organized to maintain the output attenuation regardless of input. It is, of course, possible to maintain the
*   attenuation settings such that they follow a given input, but this will require additions to this class to shift
*   potentiometer values alongside crosspoint configurations.
*
* Notes regarding hardware design....
* Normally, we would want to keep one input channel tied to ground so that otherwise unbound outputs can be tied to it
*   for improved noise suppression. But since we have the digital potentiometers on the side of the crosspoint that
*   we have designated as output, we can simply write a value to the channel's pot that achieves the same result.
* Some changes to the natural channel order were made to facilitate PCB layout. Which is the reason for the mapping
*   oddities between inputs on the switch and output channels (uint8_t pot_remap[8]).
*
* The digital potentiometers are linear across their range. Therefore, if you are going to use this class for audio,
*   you should adjust volume in a logrithmic manner. Additionally, the pots do not have zero-crossing detection. So
*   to avoid getting the "zipper" sound when changing volume, you should unroute() the channel prior to adjusting volume,
*   then route it again after the volume is set.

This class is just a way of tracking a battery charge-manager IC. Doesn't
  do much more than monitor the state of a few GPIO pins, some timers, and
  emits events when the PMIC reports changes in state. Battery charged, charge
  fault, source connection, etc...
  
This class was coded with the assumption that there would only be one such
  chip in a given system.

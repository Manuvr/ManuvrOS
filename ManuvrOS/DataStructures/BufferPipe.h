This class is meant to be the glue between a platform-abstracted transport,
  and any parser/session/presentation layer that sits on top of it (if any).

For instance: A simple parser that sits on a serial port or net socket, and
  does not require a session. This would encompass GPS, and also any transport
  bridges.

Another (more complex) case would be TLS. Two-way interchange with the transport
  happens independently of the attached Session (if any). This also allows for
  the easy selection and abstraction of TLS/DTLS from the underlying transport,
  allowing the choice to be made based on the nature of the transport.

A third use-case would be a traffic-analysis class that looks at connections
  originating in a listening transport and chooses what flavor of session
  is most-appropriate for servicing it. Thereafter performing the necessary
  association and distancing itself from further interaction.

Meaningful distinctions between datagram and stream-oriented transports ought
  to end here, with all downstream software experiencing the transport as a
  buffered stream, with the divisions between messages (if any) left to the
  classes that care.

* As function arguments, these are interpreted as directives given by the
*   sending instance, and should be treated appropriately.
* At this point, we cannot unambiguously support partial buffer transfers. The
*   receiving instance should take everything or nothing at all.

* This is an interface class that is the common-ground between...
*   ManuvrXports, which use it to move buffers out of the I/O layer.
*   XenoSessions, which use it to move buffers into the application layer.
*   XportXformers, which optionally connects these things together.
*
* The idea is have a strategy flexible-enough to facillitate basic
*   buffer-processing tasks without incurring the complexity of extending
*   XenoSession or wrapping ManuvrXport.
*
* Here, "far" refers to "farther from the counterparty". That is: closer to our
*   local idea of "the application".
* The _near pointer should _always_ be closer to the transport driver, if present.
* The _far pointer should _always_ be closer to the firmware end-point, if present.
* The _near and _far members cannot be relied upon to be present for a variety
*   of reasons. But calling those methods should always be made to be safe.
*
* TODO: Notes for the future:
* BufferPipe could be implemented as a bi-directional FIFO queue. But it isn't.
* This is a good place to wrap various IPC strategies.
* This is an *excellent* place for concurrency-control and memory-management.

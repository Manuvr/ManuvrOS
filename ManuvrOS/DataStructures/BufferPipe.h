This class is meant to be the glue between a platform-abstracted transport,
  and any parser/session/presentation layer that sits on top of it (if any).

Extending classes may be...
 ManuvrXports, which use it to move buffers across the I/O layer.
 XenoSessions, which use it to move buffers across the application layer.
 XportXformers, which optionally connects these things together.

The idea is have a strategy flexible-enough to facillitate basic
 buffer-processing tasks without incurring the complexity of extending
 XenoSession or wrapping ManuvrXport.

For instance: A simple parser that sits on a serial port or net socket, and
  does not require a session. This would encompass GPS, and also any transport
  bridges.
See ManuvrGPS for the GPS parser case.
See XportBridge for a bi-directional implementation.

Another (more complex) case would be TLS. Two-way interchange with the transport
  happens independently of the attached Session (if any). This also allows for
  the easy selection and abstraction of TLS/DTLS from the underlying transport,
  allowing the choice to be made based on the nature of the transport.
See ManuvrTLS.

A third use-case would be a traffic-analysis class that looks at connections
  originating in a listening transport and chooses what flavor of session
  is most-appropriate for servicing it. Thereafter performing the necessary
  association and distancing itself from further interaction.
See ZooKeeper.

Meaningful distinctions between datagram and stream-oriented transports ought
  to end here, with all downstream software experiencing the transport as a
  buffered stream, with the divisions between messages (if any) left to the
  classes that care.
See UDPPipe for a case where this matters.

* As return codes, these are interpreted as a declaration of the beliefs of the
*   callee instance. Therefore, a return value of zero is an error.
* As function arguments, these are interpreted as directives given by the
*   sending instance, and should be treated appropriately.
* At this point, we cannot unambiguously support partial buffer transfers. The
*   receiving instance should take everything or nothing at all.
* Remember: The issuer of the buffer has sole-authority to dictate its fate.
*   This implies that we can safely copy and transform buffers in this class if
*   we feel the need. But we need to make copies under certain circumstances.

* Notes regarding pipe-strategies...
* This is an experiment for testing an idea about building dynamic chains of
*   pipes.
* Something like this is needed to avoid having to code for a small, static set
*   of pipe combinations (IE: "Bluetooth <--> DTLS <--> Console").
*   It might be a good idea to have it in BufferPipe since this is where the
*   allocation would occur, and the datastructure nicely fits the problem.
* On the other-hand, it stands to cause us some linguistic grief of necessitating
*   this class containing knowledge of higher-layer components (thus hurting its
*   purity as a data structure).
* If the transport is always to be the progenitor of the chain, it might be better
*   to contain the definitional aspects of this idea in ManuvrXport (or the Kernel).
* Same problem as we have with Message definitions.
*
* If it remains here, the pipe-strategy should be executed on first-call to haveFar()
*   that would otherwise return false.

* Here, "far" refers to "farther from the counterparty". That is: closer to our

* The _near and _far members cannot be relied upon to be present for a variety

* TODO: Notes for the future:
* BufferPipe could be implemented as a bi-directional FIFO queue. But it isn't.
* This is a good place to wrap various IPC strategies.
* This is an *excellent* place for concurrency-control and memory-management.

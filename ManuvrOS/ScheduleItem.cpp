This class is meant to be a real-time task scheduler for small microcontrollers. It
should be driven by a periodic interrupt of some sort, but it may also be effectively
used with a reliable polling scheme (at the possible cost of timing accuracy).

A simple profiler is included which will allow the user of this class to determine
run-times and possibly even adjust task duty cycles accordingly.

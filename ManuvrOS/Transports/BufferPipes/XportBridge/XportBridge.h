Probably the simplest-possible general XportXform that isn't a bitbucket.

Takes two transports and cross-wires them such that one's output
  becomes the other's input. This is only really useful for deploying
  ManuvrOS as a transport adapter, but it will doubtless lend itself to such
  hackery as piping GPS data from serial ports over the internet without SLIP.

This class does not concern itself with network-layer tasks or anything
  above it in the OSI. It just shuttles payloads between transports as
  transparently as possible.

Unlike most other implementations of this class, this one is equidistant from
  (we presume) two counterparties. Therefore, "near" and "far" distinction is
  meaningless, provided we keep straight which is which. Combined with the
  fact that we do no transforms, this means that we simply pass traffic.

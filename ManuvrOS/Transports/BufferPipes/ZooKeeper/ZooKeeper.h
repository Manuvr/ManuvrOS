IoT sucks. There, I said it.
This is an experiment in protocol discovery in situations where no faculty such
  as the one described in IETF rfc7301 can be relied-upon to exist.

Some protocols (mostly those designed for stream-oriented transports) have some
  sort of exploitable "sync" feature so that message can be properly framed and
  extracted from the stream. If such a protocol is differentiable before any
  response is required from us, it is a candidate for this discovery mechanism.

Participating protocol wrappers need to pass a ZooInmate definition to
  registerAtZoo(ZooInmate*) in order to be included in the discovery process.

This class would be a prime place to integrate Avro or protobuf so that packers
  and parsers can be built in a uniform manner, versus being wrapped
  implementations pulled in externally.

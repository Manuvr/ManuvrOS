This driver is designed to give Manuvr platform-abstracted COM ports. By
  this is meant generic asynchronous serial ports. On Arduino, this means
  the Serial (or HardwareSerial) class. On linux, it means /dev/tty<x>.

Platforms that require it should be able to extend this driver for specific 
  kinds of hardware support. For an example of this, I would refer you to
  the STM32F4 case-offs I understand that this might seem "upside down"
  WRT how drivers are more typically implemented, and it may change later on.
  But for now, it seems like a good idea.

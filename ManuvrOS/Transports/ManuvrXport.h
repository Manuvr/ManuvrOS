This driver is designed to give Manuvr platform-abstracted COM ports. By
  this is meant generic asynchronous serial ports. On Arduino, this means
  the Serial (or HardwareSerial) class. On linux, it means /dev/tty<x>.
  It might also be a network socket.
  
Platforms that require it should be able to extend this driver for specific 
  kinds of hardware support. For an example of this, I would refer you to
  the RN42HID driver. I understand that this might seem "upside down"
  WRT how drivers are more typically implemented, and it may change later on.
  But for now, it seems like a good idea.  

XenoSessions are optionally established by this class, and broadcast to the
  rest of the system (MANUVR_MSG_SESS_ESTABLISHED). By the time that has
  happened, the session ought to have become sync'd, self-identified, 
  authenticated, etc. Therefore, session configuration must be done on a
  per-transport basis. This means that authentication (for instance) is
  transport-wide.
  
If sessions are enabled for a transport, the highest-level of the protocol
  touched by this class ought to be dealing with sync.
  
For non-session applications of this class, session-creation and management
  can be disabled. This would be appropriate in cases such as GPS, modems,
  and generally, anything that isn't manuvrable.

Note that this class does not require a XenoSession pointer. If applicable
  to a given transport, that should be handled in the class extending this 
  one.

For debuggability, the transport has a special mode for acting as a debug 
  console.

/*
* Note about MANUVR_XPORT_FLAG_HAS_SESSION:
* This might get cut. it ought to be sufficient to check if the session member is NULL.
*
* The behavior of this class, (and classes that extend it) ought to be as follows:
*   1) If a session is not present, the port simply moves data via the event system, hoping
*        that something else in the system cares.
*   2) If a session IS attached, the session should control all i/o on this port, as it holds
*        the protocol spec. So outside requests for data to be sent should be given to the session,
*        if not rejected entirely.

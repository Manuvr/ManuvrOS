This file is meant to contain a set of common functions that are typically platform-dependent.
  The goal is to make a class instance that is pre-processor-selectable for instantiation by the
  kernel, thereby giving the kernel the ability to...
    * Access the realtime clock (if applicatble)
    * Get definitions for GPIO pins.
    * Access a true RNG (if it exists)

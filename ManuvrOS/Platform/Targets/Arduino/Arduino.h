ManuvrOS has an on-again, off-again relationship WRT Arduino support.

At first, ManuvrOS was a library that was loaded into the Arduino
  environment. But this quickly became untenable because of the
  need to include libraries within libraries.

Rather than subject ourselves to the Arduino IDE and its nerfed usage
  of autotools, we will ask the user to either clone Arduino libraries
  into ManuvrOS' build tree, or require that the user provide a path
  to vis locally-installed copy.

Other platforms might inherrit from this API, so keep it general.

Specific hardware targets using Arduino's API should probably fork
  this platform, and use direct hardware features where practical.

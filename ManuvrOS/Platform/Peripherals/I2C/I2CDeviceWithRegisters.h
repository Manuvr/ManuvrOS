This class is supposed to be an i2c abstraction layer. The goal is to have
an object of this class that can be instantiated and used to communicate
with i2c devices (as a bus master) regardless of the platform.

This file is the tortured result of growing pains since the beginning of
  ManuvrOS. It has been refactored fifty-eleven times, suffered the brunt
  of all porting efforts, and has reached the point where it must be split
  apart into a more-portable platform-abstraction strategy.

/* \mainpage ManuvrOS Documentation

A cross-platform real-time, event-driven "Operating System" for asynchronous applications. It was intended to make it easier to write asynchronous, cross-platform IoT applications. Despite the name, ManuvrOS was intended to abstract threading and platform-related differences, and can be used on top of another operating system (as is the case on linux).

----------------------
#### What is in this repository:
**./doc**:  Location for generated documentation.

**./lib**:  Third-party libraries required for a project.

**./ManuvrOS**:  The ManuvrOS source code.

**./tests**:  Automated tests.

**./examples**:  Example projects.

**./downloadDeps.sh**   A script to download dependencies.


----------------------
### Building the test-bench
The test-bench consists of these files. It was meant to run on linux with possible Raspberry Pi extensions.
    FirmwareDefs.h
    main.cpp
    Makefile

##### First, you may want to download the dependencies...

    ./downloadDeps.sh


##### Vanilla linux build (no i2c, TTY, or GPIO):

    make

##### The Raspi version of the test-bench:

    make BOARD=RASPI

##### You can also enable debugging features:

    make DEBUG=1

##### The doc can be built with (requires doxygen be installed):

    make docs

##### Automated tests:

    make tests

##### Various example programs:

    make examples


----------------------
### If you intend on using ManuvrOS in an Arduino-esque environment...
Arduino support has been shelved for the moment due to restrictions in their build system. It may make a re-appearance in the future.


----------------------
#### High-level TODO list
General issues and support goals are being tracked in Trello.

#### Cred:
The ASCII art in this file was generated by [this most-excellent tool](http://patorjk.com/software/taag).

[cbor-cpp](https://github.com/naphaso/cbor-cpp) was hard-forked into Manuvr to resolve a standard library inclusion.

[pcg-c-basic](https://github.com/imneme/pcg-c-basic) was hard-forked into Manuvr to grease build system options.


Some of the drivers are adaptations from other's open code. This is noted in each specific class so derived.

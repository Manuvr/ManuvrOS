![ManuvrOS](doc/3d-logo.png)

A cross-platform real-time, event-driven "Operating System" for asynchronous applications. It was intended to make it easier to write asynchronous, cross-platform IoT applications. Despite the name, ManuvrOS was intended to abstract threading and platform-related differences, and can be used on top of another operating system (as is the case on linux).

----------------------
#### What is in this repository:
**./doc**:  Location for generated documentation.

**./lib**:  Third-party libraries required for a project.

**./ManuvrOS**:  The ManuvrOS source code.

**./tests**:  Automated tests.

**./examples**:  Example projects.

**./downloadDeps.sh**   A script to download dependencies.


----------------------
### Building the test-bench
The test-bench consists of these files. It was meant to run on linux with possible Raspberry Pi extensions.
    FirmwareDefs.h
    main.cpp
    Makefile

##### The Raspi version of the test-bench:

    make raspi

##### Vanilla linux build (no i2c, TTY, or GPIO):

    make

##### Or for the linux version with debug symbols:

    make debug

##### The doc can be built with (requires doxygen be installed):

    make docs

##### Automated tests:

    make tests

##### Various example programs:

    make examples


----------------------
### If you intend on using ManuvrOS in an Arduino-esque environment...
Arduino support has been shelved for the moment. It may make a re-appearance in the future.


----------------------
#### High-level TODO list
-   Clean up the unit tests that exist, and merge in some that aren't in the test-bench yet.
-   Verify that ManuvrOS works correctly when built as 64-bit.
-   Write an autoconf script to choose target and features, detect env, etc...
-   Continue extending session support to cover OSC, CoAP, along with their commonly-associated wire-encodings (notably CBOR). Currently, only MQTT and Manuvr native are supported.
-   Incorporate assertions into preprocessor logic to case-off DEBUG? Investigate.
-   Support additional threading models (Zephyr? RIOT? mbed?).

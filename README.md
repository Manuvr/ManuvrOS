A cross-platform real-time, event-driven "Operating System" for asynchronous applications. It was intended to make it easier to write asynchronous, cross-platform IoT applications.

----------------------
#### What is in this repository:
**./doc**:  Location for generated documentation.

**./lib**:  Third-party libraries required for a project.

**./ManuvrOS**:  The ManuvrOS source code.

**./tests**:  Automated tests.

**./downloadDeps.sh**   A script to download dependencies.


----------------------
##### Demo project files
    FirmwareDefs.h      Build-time configuration for the demo project.
    main.cpp            
    Makefile


----------------------
##### If you intend on using ManuvrOS in an Arduino-esque environment...
Arduino support has been shelved for the moment. It may make a re-appearance in the future.


----------------------
##### If you intend on using ManuvrOS as an application framework in a "big" environment (such as a Raspberry Pi, or desktop)

Hopefully-positive changes are gradually happening to the build process. For now...

You can build the demo application with

The Raspi demo application:

    make raspi

Demo application on straight-up linux (uses pthreads):

    make

Or for the same thing with debug symbols:

    make debug

The doc can be built with the command...

    make docs



----------------------
#### High-level TODO list
-   Clean up the unit tests that exist, and merge in some that aren't in the testbench yet.
-   Verify that ManuvrOS works correctly when built as 64-bit.
-   Write an autoconf script to choose target and features, detect env, etc...
-   Continue extending session support to cover OSC, CoAP, along with their commonly-associated wire-encodings (notably CBOR). Currently, only MQTT and Manuvr native are supported.
-   Incorporate assertions into preprocessor logic to case-off DEBUG? Investigate.
-   Support additional threading models (Zephyr? RIOT? mbed?).

/*
* The point of this class is to ease some of the burden of doing string manipulations.
* This class uses lots of dynamic memory internally. Some of this is exposed as public
*   members, so care needs to be taken if heap references are to be used directly.
* There are two modes that this class uses to store strings: collapsed and tokenized.
* The collapsed mode stores the entire string in the str member with a NULL root.
* The tokenized mode stores the string as sequential elements in a linked-list.
* When the full string is requested, the class will collapse the linked-list into the str
*   member, respecting the fact that part of the string may already have been collapsed into
*   str, in which case, str will be prepended to the linked-list, and the entire linked-list
*   then collapsed. Needless to say, this shuffling act might cause the class to more-than
*   double its memory usage while the string is being reorganized. So be aware of your memory
*   usage.
*
* Note(0) regarding heap_ref():
* Sometimes, it may be desirable to return an instance of this class from a function. In that
*   case, the function doing the return should....
*      return str_builder.heap_ref();
*   This will cause the class to make a copy of itself on the heap. To avoid doubling the RAM usage,
*   the data-carrying elements are NOT copied, but the references are marked in the original instance
*   in such a way as to NOT be free()'d when the destructor is called. Therefore, the responsibility
*   of cleaning up the memory allocated by the class falls on the caller. It should be free()'d like so...
*      StringBuilder* obj = someFxn();   // someFxn() returns the result of heap_ref()...
*      // Do some things with the returned string....
*      obj.clear();       // Frees the allocated memory taken up by the strings.
*      free(obj);         // Frees the allocated memory taken up by the class itself.
* This is always safe to do, assuming that obj is not NULL. If the class contained a zero-length string,
*   the worst thing that will happen is wasted cycles. The class will do its own sanity-checks in the 
*   clear() function. 
*
* Note(1) regarding str_heap_ref():
* Like heap_ref(), str_heap_ref() will return a heap-allocated reference to the str member of this class
*   after collapsing it. This is done when the caller is expecting a simple (char*). This will not work
*   very well with unsigned character strings because no length can be returned. So the caller needs to
*   be sure that the StringBuilder wasn't built with unsigned character strings.
* If the caller is expecting (unsigned char*), it should do this instead...
*      int str_len = 0;
*      unsigned char* str = someFxn(&str_len);   // someFxn() returns the result of str_heap_ref()...
*                                                // str_len will contain the length of the string.
*      free(str);       // It is still on us to free the allocated memory taken up by the strings.

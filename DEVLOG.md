* Pipe-strategy works, even if a bit cumbersome linguistically.
* Memory-management cleanup and simplifications in BufferPipe.
* Tremendous cleanup effort surrounding inherited virtuals and alignments.
* NULL ---> nullptr for static analysis reasons. Sadly this broke [a pejoration of PriorityQueue](http://www.joshianlindsay.com/index.php?id=145) that I was quite fond of.
* Rough Teensy3 USB VCP support under ManuvrSerial.
* Dropping all pretense of supporting C++ standards below C++11.
* Furthering the goal of threading-model unification.
* Teensy3 platform fixes.
* GPS via TCP works.
* Addition of examples in their own directory.
* TLS client improvements.

* More constructor delegation, inlining, and cruft-removal in data structures.
* 64-bit builds now work, and so does valgrind.
* More platform-specific support.
* Ground broken on uniform crpyto API issue by adding hash support via mbedtls.
* Toying with UUID libraries, Avro, and SensorManager.
* Will be using Jansson for JSON support, despite the higher overhead. Avro depends on it.

    2223011   30588  121432 2375031  243d77 manuvr  Prior to addressing technical debt in Argument class.
    2223011   30588  121432 2375031  243d77 manuvr  Making args private, and inlining accessor.
    2225739   30588  121432 2377759  24481f manuvr  Making event_code private, and inlining accessor. Owch... 2.7KB.

I believe the space penalty is being caused by the added function call in every place the (now private)
  event_code member is being accessed outside of the class. This means a runtime compute penalty.
  Nevertheless, I am retaining it for now. I will reclaim it later when the abstraction is re-generalized.

### 2016.08.27:
Major strides. UUID type taken from iotivity-constrained. Might end up taking
  more code from that package if I can't easily link against it as it stands.
The testing effort was advanced back into a state of relevance. The DataStructure
  tests are now bearing the code responsible for reporting type sizes.
  Still need to choose a good framework for automated-testing.

* More constructor delegation, inlining, and cruft-removal in data structures.
* 64-bit builds now work, and so does valgrind.
* More platform-specific support.
* Ground broken on uniform crpyto API issue by adding hash support via mbedtls.
* Toying with UUID libraries, Avro, and SensorManager.

I believe the space penalty is being caused by the added function call in every place the (now private)
  event_code member is being accessed outside of the class. This means a runtime compute penalty.
  Nevertheless, I am retaining it for now. I will reclaim it later when the abstraction is re-generalized.

Major strides. UUID type taken from iotivity-constrained. Might end up taking
  more code from that package if I can't easily link against it as it stands.
The testing effort was advanced back into a state of relevance. The DataStructure
  tests are now bearing the code responsible for reporting type sizes.
  Still need to choose a good framework for automated-testing.

  At some point Sunday night during the Identity abstraction, I crossed the binary size that was my former maximum since switching back to 32-bit builds.

  Today was a mad binge. Turning in for the night.

### 2016.09.05:
Much thankless grind this weekend. Driver modernization, Teensy3 support. Followed
  that up with storage implementation on Teensy3, and moved into CBOR support.

While including CBOR for Viam Sonus, I ran up against the fact that my microcontroller
  builds do not include the C standard library. I still haven't sorted out how to handle it,
  but I found a gem while I was working the problem.

Adding gc-sections to my linker directives caused this:

       text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
    2008463   16860   53988 2079311  1fba4f manuvr
    1743591   12160   50148 1805899  1b8e4b manuvr

I am now using Viam Sonus as my IoT desk lamp, as it is the only source of light
  in the room apart from my monitors.

Update: I am handling the linker issue by hard-forking cbor-cpp, and mod'ing it
  to not depend on srt:string. This represented a needless addition of ~50KB to
  Viam Souns (~50% increase!). As long as I've forked it in this manner, I can
  safely add the parse-in-place stuff that makes such an enormous memory
  difference.

Finally moved the remaining message definitions out of the CPP file that handles their logic.
  They now reside in the kernel, where they will be scrutinized in the near future.
  This resolved a bug I've been having since the conversion of the Kernel to stack
  allocation along with platform. The problem was centered around the order-of-exec
  for static intializers.

CBOR loop closes tighter. Test is correct, and massively-extended. Simple map
  support. It will be enough to write the next phase of the storage API. Commit...

### 2016.09.07:
I finally found the crash on program exit, that was specific to linux. It was
  in the kernel destructor. This has been a problem for a LONG time (at least
  8-months), but never surfaced because the kernel was never torn down. After
  the recent platform abstraction improvements, the linux build exits naturally
  and therefore invokes the kernel destructor as it leaves scope.
For technical reasons, microcontroller programs simply halt, or hard-jump to a
  bootloader, debug, or reset vector.

Much OIC wrapper. Such ugly. But it will make a great toy very soon. If it
  works out, I'll clean up the bindings to iotivity-constrained, and make
  it integrate more naturally. Right now, it's lifted demo code.

    1910674   12740   66404 1989818  1e5cba With OIC support via iotivity-constrained.

Lots of redundant crap in that build. Two of everything.
Two DTLS stacks. Two IP adapters. Two CBOR implementations. Two CoAP PDU parsers/packers.
EVERYTHING.

It won't stay this way, and ALL of that redundancy is due to the hasty graft of
  another wide-scope package. Commit. Sleep.

### 2016.09.09:

Alright... I've been putting this off.

##### Today's situation:
BufferPipes have been thread/mem safe to this point because they are synchronous.
Although state might mutate in an unsafe manner within the objects that extend
BufferPipe, the fate of the memory was not at risk of being in-question.

##### The issue is this:
This causes deeeeep call stacks. Here is a recent callgrind graph. Task was parsing CoAP packets and dumping results to kernel log (StandardIO).
2016.09.09-callgrind.png

This is _fine_ for a linux build. But will start to cause problems in tight-spaces.

So....
I now have to implement some simple next_tick() style functionality to cause an
automatic synchronicity-break for transfers that desire it.

Full platform polymorphism achieved.

The next_tick() idea was implemented, but no tests written yet. So I'll have a fun surprise later. More identity and CBOR extension...

**Messages need to do these things...**

  * Pack/parse for transport.
  * Convey asynchronous events internally
  * Carry context-specific arguments
  * Carry knowledge of their GC policy
  * Be passed uniformly
  * Be bridged with outbound transport messages. IE, be locked and held by modules.
  * Be statically-allocated.
  * Be schedulable by the kernel.
  * Carry callback pointers as either a class or fxn*.

    1743503   12160   49892 1805555  1b8cf3 Shaved a few more redundancies. Doc cleanup.


**Review:**

  * Merged ManuvrRunnable down into ManuvrMsg. The merger is not yet complete. There is presently a namespace-stitch being performed by a typedef.
  * Some much-needed cruft-removal was done. Scheduler has been reworked a bit to enhance safety, readability, consistency. General "best-practices" work.
  * Wrote a set of stubs for testing schedules. Nothing filled in yet. Makefile break-out for tests.
  * Finished the preprocessor case-offs to allow building without the profiler. It's a special class of debugging tool that will never find a place in production builds.
  * Finally lost a bad idea (soft-idempotency).
  * Doxygen conformance audit in ManuvrMsg.

  Looks like my re-work shaved 256-bytes of resting memory load and ~900 bytes of flash. But it also saved a number of heavily-trafficked virtual execution pathways.

The ManuvrRunnable namespace died at 03:59 PST on 2016.10.09. A brief re-cap of its evolution feels appropriate.

In the beginning, there was ScheduleItem, ManuvrMsg, and Event (which was the child of ManuvrMsg). Each did its own specific job, and for a time, it was good.

Then, much complexity was built around scheduling events. Darkness settled over the code base. Dissatisfied with the uneasy truce between ScheduleItem and Event, the monarch forged the two into one hasty blob and named it ManuvrRunnable (which still extended ManuvrMsg).

This worked for awhile, but was only a thin veneer over the disharmony between the two original houses. True resolution of the split happened gradually over many ages (about twelve months).  The final battle was waged today between ManuvrMsg and ManuvrRunnable on the battlefield of "Namespace". ManuvrMsg was the victor.
